# FutuRaM
[Official website](https://www.futuram.eu)

FutuRaM will develop the Secondary Raw Materials knowledge base on the availability and recoverability of secondary raw materials (SRMs) within the European Union (EU), with a special focus on critical raw materials (CRMs). The project research will enable fact-based decision making for the recovery and use of SRMs within and outside the EU, and disseminate the data generated via an accessible knowledge base developed in the project.

The FutuRaM project seeks to quantify the current and future availability of secondary raw materials
(SRM) with a focus on critical raw materials (CRM) for six waste streams.

These are:

- waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE)  
- waste batteries (BAT)  
- end-of-life vehicles (ELV)  
- mining waste (MIN)  
- slags and ashes (SLASH)  
- construction and demolition (CDW)
