The FutuRaM project seeks to quantify the current and future availability of secondary raw materials
(SRM) with a focus on critical raw materials (CRM) for six waste streams.

These are:

- waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE)  
- waste batteries (BAT)  
- end-of-life vehicles (ELV)  
- mining waste (MIN)  
- slags and ashes (SLASH)  
- construction and demolition (CDW)
